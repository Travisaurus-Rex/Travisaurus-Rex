# 👋 Hi, I'm Travis Adams

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a strong frontend focus and nearly a decade of experience building and modernizing web applications. I specialize in refactoring legacy systems, converting monoliths to microservice architectures, and creating scalable apps with modern frontend frameworks.

I enjoy designing fast, maintainable UIs and crafting thoughtful, intuitive user experiences, whether for internal tools or public-facing products. I’ve worked across industries and teams, and I’m always exploring new technologies and approaches to make applications more efficient, resilient, and user-friendly.

Outside of work, I freelance, experiment with creative projects, and continually expand my toolkit to push my work further.

## 💻 What I Work With

**Languages & Frameworks**  
JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, HTML/CSS  
React, Angular, Next.js, Node.js, .NET

**Tools & Tech**  
GitLab, AWS, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, Docker 
Unit Testing, Agile/Scrum, CI/CD, UX/UI Design

**Currently Exploring**  
NextJS, React Native • GoLang • Edge deployment • Accessibility • Performance profiling

## 🏄‍♂️ When I’m Not Coding...

You’ll find me riding motorcycles through winding roads, lifting heavy things in the gym, playing video games, or catching live music somewhere loud. I also enjoy creative writing and horror lore—sometimes both at once.

## 🛰 Remote & Ready

I'm a US citizen working fully remote and async-friendly. I love working with distributed teams and I thrive in collaborative environments where trust, curiosity, and ownership are key.
