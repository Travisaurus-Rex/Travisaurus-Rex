# Hello, World!

## About Me

Full stack developer currently building software at Meyer Distributing.
I have a strong professional background in building Angular apps, but I work with React too.
I also build web APIs with .NET, but I'm stack agnostic and interested in learning new tools.

Currently looking for new work and setting down new roots!
