# Hi, I'm Travis Adams

I’m a senior full-stack engineer with years of experience building and improving complex applications. Angular has been the foundation of my UI work, and I bring the same level of capability to React and other frameworks because my strength is in JavaScript and TypeScript themselves, not in any single tool.

On the backend, my approach is shaped by several years working with enterprise-scale .NET systems, where structure and architecture mattered. I now apply that background across modern ecosystems. Node and Nest.js are where I build most of my event-driven services and multi-layered APIs. When a system demands high concurrency or small, focused services, I turn to Go. Python has been part of my toolkit for a long time, and recently I’ve expanded that into FastAPI applications, automation work, and AI-assisted tools.

Each technology plays a specific role in how I design systems. I choose the stack that fits the problem, the architecture, and the long-term goals of the project.

## What I Am Building Now

### 1. Bazaar: Full-Stack Marketplace Platform
A complete marketplace application built as a professional-grade full-stack project.

**Backend:**  
Nest.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL  
Features include authentication, role management, product listings, carts, orders, and reviews.  
Structured in a way that emphasizes clarity, modularity, and long-term maintainability.

**Frontend:**  
Angular 21
Uses standalone components, signals, and a clean organizational approach that pairs with the backend.

Bazaar reflects how I approach full-stack engineering as a whole.

### 2. Python with FastAPI for Automation and Note Processing
A FastAPI backend focused on practical automation tasks such as text processing, transcription workflows, and TTS utilities.  
Built to explore Python's strength in rapid prototyping, simple API creation, and productivity tools.

---

### 3. Unreal Engine 5: Third-Person Adventure Project
A creative project where I design gameplay systems, interaction logic, animation states, and event-driven mechanics.  
This project is outside of web development but aligns with how I think about systems and interactive design.

## Outside of Work

I spend my time riding motorcycles, lifting weights, playing games, listening to live music, and writing fiction.  
I enjoy creative work, especially anything involving horror or storytelling.

---

## Remote Availability

I am a United States citizen with bases in both the US and Indonesia.  
I am open to remote roles across US and Asia Pacific time zones. I'm fine with unorthodox work hours! 
I work best in teams that value clarity, trust, and personal ownership of the work.
