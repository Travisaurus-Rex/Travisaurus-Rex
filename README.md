# 👋 Hi, I'm Travis Adams

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a strong frontend focus and nearly a decade of experience turning legacy systems into modern web apps. I build fast, maintainable UIs and enjoy crafting thoughtful, intuitive user experiences—whether it's for internal tooling or public-facing products.

I’ve worked across industries and teams, from rebuilding a massive JSP application with .NET and Angular to leading frontend development on logistics platforms. I also freelance, tinker with creative projects, and spend a lot of time learning new tools to push my work further.

## 💻 What I Work With

**Languages & Frameworks**  
JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, HTML/CSS  
React, Angular, Next.js, Node.js, .NET

**Tools & Tech**  
GitLab, AWS, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, REST APIs  
Unit Testing, Agile/Scrum, CI/CD, UX/UI Design

**Currently Exploring**  
NextJS, React Native • Python • Figma • Edge deployment • Accessibility • Performance profiling

## 🏄‍♂️ When I’m Not Coding...

You’ll find me riding motorcycles through winding roads, lifting heavy things in the gym, playing video games, or catching live music somewhere loud. I also enjoy creative writing and horror lore—sometimes both at once.

## 🛰 Remote & Ready

I'm a US citizen currently based in Indonesia, fully remote and async-friendly. I love working with distributed teams and I thrive in collaborative environments where trust, curiosity, and ownership are key.
